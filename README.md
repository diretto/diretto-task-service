# diretto Task Service

The Task API is an additional service API that provides support for advanced task management between different platform users while reporting, but also thereafter. It represents an optional service API that does not belong to the core platform, although deployments will be beneficial in most scenarios.

Please refer to the API documentation: http://diretto.github.com/diretto-api-doc/v2/diretto-ext/task.html
